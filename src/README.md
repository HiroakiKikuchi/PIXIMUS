PIXIMUS
====

A shellscript to run XDS with changing input parameters.

## Description

PIXIMUS is originally written for X-ray structure analysis of protein [pseudo-single-crystal method](http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?db5060). Diffractions from a protein pseudo-single-crystal are much different from those from a single crystal. In particular, when a degree of orientation is not high, popular methods for single crystals cannot integrate intensity of diffractions well. Many trial and error on selections of XDS input parameters are needed.

PIXIMUS automates:
- selection of input parameters
- output error lists
- output lattice lists
- filtering by lattice volume
- replacement of detector parameters
- output statistics from CORRECT.LP(Now, findR.sh supports this fuction.)

*PIXIMUS is a makeshift and throwaway code for author's research and mainly for private use and for my co-workers. I don't plan to continue to improve this.*

## Requirement

- OS: linux (If you want to use in other OS, you need to modify some commands. e.g. sed => gsed)
- Python 3
- Python modules: numpy, texttable



## Usage

1. Create XDS_template.PIX refer to default one. This is just XDS.INP generated by generate_XDS.INP or by hand. It is useful to separate section for PIXIMUS.
1. Create INPPAR.PIX refer to default one. This is a CSV file. First row: name of input parameters, others: input parameters you want change.
1. Fix codes for filtering lattice volume in PIXIMUS.sh.
1. Run PIXIMUS.sh.



## Install

Copy PIXIMUS.sh, product.py, INPPAR.PIX, XDS_template.PIX to local.
